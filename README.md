# Writing An Interpreter In Go

Thank you for purchasing "Writing An Interpreter In Go"! In this folder you'll
find the book in several different formats:

* PDF
* ePub, for reading in iBooks
* mobi, for Kindles and the Kindle app
* HTML, for reading it in the browser

The `images` folder contains the graphics included in the book. They are used by
the HTML version.

In the `code` folder you'll find the final result of each chapter. The code
should be compilable and runnable if you set your $GOPATH to the top-level
folder for each chapter. Every chapter folder also contains an `.envrc` file. If
you have direnv (http://direnv.net/) installed then the $GOPATH should be
automatically set for you as soon as you `cd` into the directories.

If you have any question, send me an email: me@thorstenball.com

Enjoy the book!
